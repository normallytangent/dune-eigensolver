## Hi, this was the output from the script I ran:
$ > ./dune-common/bin/duneproject dune-eigensolver 

A sample code dune-eigensolver.cc is generated in the "dune-eigensolver" directory.       
Look at the README and dune.module files there.                                           
Now you can run the dunecontrol script which will setup the new module.                  
Sometimes you may have to tweak CMakeLists.txt a bit.
